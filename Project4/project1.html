      <h3>Paranoia</h3> 
      <p>Paranoia is a short film which explores the idea of unpredictable danger within familiar situations. The overarching concept brought to light is that danger subconsciously lurks in typical neighbourhoods, and that even innocent looking children can deceive adults and more harmful and evil as they seem.

An example is a door closing scene, the sound indicates the strength and mood of the character, a creaky old door effect gives a creepy effect, while a loud slamming of the door indicates the character might be in a bad mood.

In terms of editing, I utilised quick jump cuts, transitions and

I chose the concept of paranoia as it is an idea that intrigues me. As a child, I had similar fears of the characters depiocted, hence I wanted to enhance the fear and

<p> 
Growing up with psychological movies such as “The Shining” by Stanley Kubrick, I was influenced to create a slowburn dramaticised short film.

<p> 
Another influence of aesthetic and genre was “Parasite” by Bong Joon Ho, in particular, the rapid pacing of the scenes and juxtaposition - how one scene cuts to another and seamlessly adds onto the effect.
