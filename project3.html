            <h3>Goodnight Ramen &nbsp; (๑ᵔ⤙ᵔ๑) </h3> 
            <p> A cherished childhood memory I aimed to incorporate was enjoying mum's delicious cooking and being cozy indoors whilst watching the rain outside. But on the contrary, I also vividly remember having an underlying fear of night rain, especially when I was alone without my family by my side. Hence my ‘goodnight ramen environment is a combination of both memories, a transition between positive and negative emotions.  my mum's homemade cooking and bunny toy, comforts me against my fears of the dark. I wanted to show the ending of the transformation as a beautiful garden wonderland as a reward of my courage to face my fears.

        <h3>Reflection Questions</h3>
        <br>
        <p>While making this environment, a <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">working prototype</span></strong>  was essential to ensure the player can walk around and explore the main areas of the environment. This process offered an insight into potential mistakes in building as well as map building. Prior to adding details such as auditory effects, textures and light adjustments, an initial walkthrough allowed me to have a clear vision of </p>
        <br>
        <p>Compared to a <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">two dimensional</span></strong> media work, creating a <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">three dimensional</span></strong> environment was definitely a big challenge. One of the hardest tasks were to initially learn a new application in itself - Unity’s controls, ability to change perspectives and shortcuts were difficult to grasp. Environmental effects were also 
            reflections and shadows from the light, 
            Working in three dimensionality was also more time consuming as little changes to a model can alter various surrounding items - such as moving or changing the angle a source light slightly can change the overall shadow of the scene
            The height of the character and the virtual camera was also an interesting item which I had trouble with at the start.

        <br>
        <p><strong><span style="color: #aa786f">The virtual camera</span></strong> was a crucial part of this project as the ability to manouver camera angles meant that every side had to be considered - instead of focusing on a specific visual target, the player can drift their focus onto other objects - this is both a positive and negative aspect. I found it beneficial as the player is free to explore the space in it’s entirety
            the negative was that sometimes the player does not know what item to interact with or which direction to move to, unless a word or visual prompt was given - this meant that the storyline and idea needed to be clearer and less ambiguous
            
            the limited movement

        <p> <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">Sound</span></strong>  in my environment was split into three main parts for the three different map scenes. The ambiance added depth and character to the scenes 

            Although I did not have time to create additional sound effects, if given the chance, I would definitely add more environmental effects such as door closing, wind rustling, footsteps and even birds chirping.

            Different elements were unified through the use of colour and style - realistic yet childlike

        <br>
        <p><strong><span style="color: #aa786f">Play testing</span></strong>  was important in this environment as it assisted me in realising the use of captions and instructional guides. When offered friends the free reign to play the game without any information, they were confused at the aim of the game, and the direction of the player - some couldn’t even find the pathway to the different environments which prevented the aim of the game.

            Upon adding on-screen text prompts and little informational notes, users were able to navigate the environment and play the game to my desired outcome - reaching the end environment of the peaceful garden.
