      <h3>Paranoia</h3> 
      <p>Paranoia is a short film which explores the idea of unpredictable danger within familiar situations. The overarching concept brought to light is that danger subconsciously lurks in typical neighbourhoods, and that even innocent looking children can deceive adults and more harmful and evil as they seem.
    <br>
    <br>
        Suspenseful and anxiety provoking, paranoia aims to create an uneasy mood for the audience and creates a sense of overthinking and catastrophising in a visually engaging way. </p>

<h3>Reflection </h3>
<br>

<p> 
Upon watching the different archival videos on the assignment task, I was particularly drawn to the idea of <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">paranoia and fear came to my mind and 
To depict a child's innocent fearful imagination, I chose ambiguous scenes from the <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">“Home Alone”</span></strong> video, and combined it with suspenseful sound effects and music. Voiceover from <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">"New Town"</span></strong> was also used.
I came to the realisation that <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">sound</span></strong> can influence the audience’s perspective of the situation, and assist in creating a particular emotion or mood. An example is a door closing scene, the sound indicates the strength and mood of the character, a creaky old door effect gives a creepy effect, while a loud slamming of the door indicates the character might be in a bad mood. 
</p>
<br>
<p> 
In terms of <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">editing</span></strong>, I utilised quick jump cuts, transitions and fade to black to build up an uneasy feeling with twisting normal everyday situations to an uncomfortable one. I also created unpredictable sequence and motion of scenes (makes audience disoriented and confused) and paired audio effects with movement and timing for shock emphasis.
I aimed to explore the possibility of catastrophising (what if the worst happens), by hiding lots of details and allowing time of visual silence for the audience to imagine the extent of fear.
I chose the concept of paranoia as it is an idea that intrigues me. As a child, I had similar fears of the characters depiocted, hence I wanted to enhance the fear and create a thriller short.
</p>
<br>
<p> 
Growing up with psychological movies such as “The Shining” by Stanley Kubrick, I was influenced to create a slowburn dramaticised short film. His works inspired me to utilise tension and dramaticised music/ audio effects as well as the "Mickey Mousing" technique of matching a sound effect to movement (eg head turning with a violin shriek).
Another influence of <strong><span style="color: #aa786f">aesthetic and genre</span></strong> was “Parasite” by Bong Joon Ho, in particular, the rapid pacing of the scenes and juxtaposition - how one scene cuts to another and seamlessly adds onto the effect. Quick, fast paced, continuous sequences and using timing to emphasise effects (eg slow down to let audience catch breath, then lots of jump cuts). In terms of content and angles however, I took Jordan Peele's build up of scenes and close ups of facial expressions and body movement details (eg close up of how someone stirs their tea can indicate character traits), especially similar to his renowned movie "Get Out".
